### `brew cask`

Homebrew Cask extends Homebrew and brings its elegance, simplicity, and speed to OS X applications and large binaries alike.

To use cask. In iterm:

- `brew install cask`
- `brew cask install sublime-text3`

If you install Sublime Text this way it will create a symlinking `subl` for you in '/usr/local/bin/subl'` No more need for manual setup!
