### `brew cask`

Homebrew Cask extends Homebrew and brings its elegance, simplicity, and speed to OS X applications and large binaries alike.

To use cask:

`brew install cask`
`brew cask install sublime-text3`

Perks: `==> Symlinking Binary 'subl' to '/usr/local/bin/subl'` - No more need to create a `subl` symlink manually!
